Game Mechanics:

A turn-based JRPG battle system based upon the mechanics from Octopath Traveler.

You can inspect the turn order on the top left of the screen.
You can inspect your character's status on the top right of the screen.

On your turn, a menu will appear next to your character, you can select from attack or using spells. 
Heal targets a party member, while the others target an enemy.
Enemies are weak to certain elements: they will appear below the enemy when discovered.
When you attack an enemy with an element it is weak to, you will reduce it's Break Counter by 1.
When the enemies Break Counter reaches 0, they will be broken.
When broken, the enemy will turn red, and they will not be able to take their turn during the current and next turn phase.
During this time, enemies take double damage from attacks and abilities.
After a turn of being broken, enemies will recover; they get priority in the next turn.

Each turn, your character recovers BP.
BP is used to increase the power of the next action your character takes, including healing.
This combos very well when the enemy is broken.
When a character uses BP, they will not recover any the following the turn.
